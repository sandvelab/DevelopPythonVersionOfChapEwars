# Folder structure

What each directory is for, and the one rule that governs it. Create every folder with a
`README.md` at the same time.

```
<repo>/
├── readme-at-start.md      what THIS project is           read first, every session

```

Folders shown in `<angle brackets>` or under `AI-generated/` and `AI-internal/` beyond the
first row are what a project typically adds; they do not exist in a fresh copy.

## The rule for each

| Folder | Rule |
|---|---|
| `analysis/` | `run.sh` at the root reproduces everything. Alternatives stay in the tree. Never create nodes by hand — use `/node`. |
| `environment/` | One environment for the whole analysis. A node-level override must justify itself in that node's `claim.md`. |
| `Archive/` | Read-only and write-once. Text documents are marked `(IS_SHADOW)` on line 2; data files cannot be, because inserting a line would edit them and break their checksums, so their folder's `README.md` and `provenance.md` carry the statement instead. Anything needing change is copied out first. |
| `AI-generated/` | Everything here is rebuilt by a recorded recipe. Never hand-edit; if it is wrong, its source is wrong. |
| `AI-internal/` | The machinery. Scripts have a dual API/CLI interface. |
| `Human-input/` | Mine. You execute plans from here; you do not rewrite them except to add output links and to fill in the ledger. |
| `Human-AI-collaboration/claims/` | The only route from results to text. |
| `Human-AI-collaboration/manuscript/` | Downstream of claims, never upstream. |

## Node directories

Sub-analyses are named `NN_shortName`, numbered in the order the parent runs them;
alternatives are named `a_shortName`, `b_shortName`, because they are unordered and only one
runs on the main path. Each holds `claim.md`, `run.sh`, `scripts/`, `results/`,
`provenance/`, and `env/` only where it overrides the main environment.
